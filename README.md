How does TypeScript enforce type safety in this object-oriented program?

- It restrics variable and return vlaues to certain types, and alerts you to issues during the development process.

How did inheritance reduce code duplication for PhysicalProduct and DigitalProduct?

- I was able to code less because many properties and methods already existed on the parent class and could be accessed from the child class.

What are the benefits of using encapsulation and access modifiers (public, private, protected) in this context?

- You can controll which properties can be accessed from outside of the class.

If you had to add a new type of product (e.g., a SubscriptionProduct), how would polymorphism make this extension straightforward?

- It would allow me to quickly reuse the existing class, but make additional tweaks and changes to the subclass.
